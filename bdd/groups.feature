Scenario Outline: Add new group
  Given a group list
  Given a group with <name>, <header> and <footer>

  | name2 | header2 | footer2 |

  Given a non-empty group list
  Given a random group from the list
  When I delete the group from the list
  Then the new group list is equal to the old group list without the deleted group

  Given a random group from the list
  Given a group with <name>, <header> and <footer>
  When I modify the group from the list
